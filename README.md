# Striche streichen

"Striche streichen" also called: Nim-Spiel or Marienbad is a simple "Tic-Tac-Toe" like game, just better.

Two player play against each other.

Rules:

- The players stroke as many lines as they like one after another
  - on one go you are only allowed to stroke lines in one row
  - if one of the lines in the middle is already stoked you can not stroke over it
- The player who strokes the last line looses

Usually you play this with pen and paper.
This Code is the most basic implementation for this game as a Website using Flutter.
